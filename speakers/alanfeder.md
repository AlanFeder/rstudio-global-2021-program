# Categorical Embeddings: New Ways to Simplify Complex Data

In Natural Language Processing, people have used neural networks to create word embeddings, representations of each word as a set of continuous numbers that can be used in other statistical and machine learning tasks.  Categorical embeddings are an extension of this idea outside of the NLP world into traditional structured data.  This method can help us use categorical data inside of models that usually require all inputs to be continuous numbers.  Additionally, these embeddings can be analyzed to learn more about the categories themselves.

While there are a number of lessons on how to use Keras (usually in Python) to create these embeddings, this talk will use embed, an extension of the recipes package to create the embeddings.
