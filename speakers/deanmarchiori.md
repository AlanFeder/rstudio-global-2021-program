# How reproducible am I? An honest retrospective on a year of commercial data science projects in R

Reproducibility is a critical aspect in science to enable trust & communication. In R, many tools exist to bring in the best practices of reproducibility into the hands of data scientists. However, outside of a research setting, how does reproducibility hold up in commercial data science projects? In this talk I take an honest retrospective of my own commercial R projects in the last year. I look at the various types of analyses completed, and which workflows were selected and why. Through this process we can learn how workflow choices may help in the short term but hinder in the long term. More importantly what can be done strike the balance between progress and perfection when doing data science in the wild?
