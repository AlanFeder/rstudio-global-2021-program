# Using formr to create R-powered surveys with individualized feedback

This talk demonstrates how the formr study framework extends the power and flexibility of R to surveys for data collection. Using R and RMarkdown code, researchers and teachers can use the formr platform to generate both simple surveys and complex studies with individualized feedback. The platform is built on a web-based application programming interface for R via OpenCPU, enabling complex features such as automated email and text message reminders, adaptive testing, graphical and interactive feedback, and integration with external data sources. I will showcase three examples: 1) a timed, randomized quiz, 2) a simple survey with individualized graphical feedback, and 3) a complex survey with unique, randomized questions for each respondent.
