# plumber v1.0: Async + OpenAPI v3

{plumber} is an R package that allows users to create web APIs by decorating R functions using {roxygen2}-like comments. In the latest release, asynchronous code (using {future} or {promises}) may be inserted at any stage of a {plumber} route execution, enabling parallel processing using multiple cores.  In addition, {plumber} has upgraded its API specification to OpenAPI v3 to better integrate with existing services.  In this talk, I will go through how you can set up your own asynchronous {plumber} API and how to enhance the default OpenAPI specification.
