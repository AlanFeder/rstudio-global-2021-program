# Making the jump from learning to applying: R training and documentation for different levels of expertise

How do you make the leap from learning R to actively applying R in your professional work? Especially if you're learning R on your own, without prior coding experience, and with few fellow R users in proximity, jumping across the chasm from training tutorials to coding for your own project can seem impossible. This talk will explore characteristics of different levels of expertise in R (novice, competent practitioner, expert), and community composition related to expertise in an academic research setting. I'll discuss the type of support required for R users to move up from one level of expertise to the next, and how different types of training and documentation can support R users at each level.
