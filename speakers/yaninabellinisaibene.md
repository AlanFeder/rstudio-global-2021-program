# On Interactive Tutorials with learnr::

Teaching R is part of my activities as an R-Ladies organizer, an RStudio Certified Instructor, a conference chair, and a researcher. Last year I started using the {learnr} package to generate interactive tutorials to teach R asynchronously. The addition of the Tutorials panel in RStudio IDE and the need for virtual classes made the use of this package even more interesting. In this talk, I will tell you what you can use these tutorials for, how to generate and publish them, what other packages you can use with {learnr}, how to make your tutorials more findable and reusable, and how to add pedagogical tools to the tutorial.
