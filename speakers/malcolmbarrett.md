# Zen and the Art of R Package Development

Modern tools in R development like usethis make it easy to work with packages, and treating projects as packages makes it easier to write reproducible code. When you write R packages, you also unlock a whole ecosystem of tools that will make it easier to test, document, and share your code. A fundamental belief in Zen is that you are already complete, that you already have everything you need. I’ll talk about why your project is already an R package, why you’re already an R package developer, and why you already have the skills to walk the path of development. (An extended version of this talk was offered at the NY R meetup in March 2020.)
