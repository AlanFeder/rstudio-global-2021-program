# How I became a Data Composer – examples of simulated datasets that bring value to a data-driven company

How can I get the buy-in from business partners to use more advanced techniques? What can I do to make a data project involving several teams more efficient? And how can I train analysts who do not (yet) have access to sensitive data?
A good data composer is skilled at creating suitable data quickly and efficiently. R has many helpful functions when it comes to simulating independent variables and composing those variables in a meaningful way to solve problems.
In this talk, I will share how I started creating data and how this skill helped me to solve some of the issues described above. With three examples – small, medium-size and large data composition – I want to encourage attendees to simulate data and enrich their data skill set.
