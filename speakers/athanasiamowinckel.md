# Make a package - Make some friends

In 2017, I had never exposed my code to anyone other than a select few before, and I was terrified. I had some functions made from a colleagues script that I thought might be useful for others, and dared myself to make a package and push it to github.

In stead of the dreaded ridiculing of poor code and development, people embraced the package and helped us make it better. Within just a couple of days, pull requests came from others to help us improve the code, implement tests, and improve documentation. I learned so much just by looking through the PRs and seeing how others worked. 

Rather than make me shy off development, the R neuro community's positive feedback has helped me find a new interest and joy in developing tools.
