# oRganization: Building an R package-verse for your org

Many case studies demonstrate the benefits of organizations developing internal R packages. But how do you move your organization from individual internal packages to a coherent internal ecosystem?

This talk will define an ontology of internal tools that meet different jobs-to-be-done, from unblocking IT challenges to democratizing tribal knowledge. 

Next, we will explore design principles and practices for internal packages and consider how these deviate from open-source standards due to organizationsâ€™ unique opportunities and constraints.

Finally, we will demonstrate how an internal ecosystem can maximize its impact by fully leveraging the RStudio IDE, including features like snippets, add-ins, templates, and the new visual editor.
